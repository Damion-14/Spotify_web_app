### Spotify_web_app

Spotify application to make playlists based on different inputs
It would be ideal to have a easy to use UI where people can input songs/artist/genres they like and get a playlist based off that.
Maybe incorporate chatgpt/bing to allow people to tell them a mood of music and output certian tags to make a playlist matching that discription
